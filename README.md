# proxy-server-droplets

This proxy server serves the purpose of enabling my Droplets app to communicate with an external API that I used. 
It is required for proper functionality of that application. 
Droplets' repo is located here: https://github.com/williamkimball/financeApp.
In order to run the server:

1. Fork this repo and clone it to your machine.
1. cd into the folder containing this repo
1. run npm install in the terminal inside this folder to install dependencies
1. run node server.js and you should see "listening on port 6060". If so, everything should be running properly.
